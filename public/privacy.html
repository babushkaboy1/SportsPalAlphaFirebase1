            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 2025</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>Who we are.</strong> SportsPal ("SportsPal," "we," "us," "our") provides a platform to discover, join, and organize sports activities and chat with other users. Contact: sportspalapplication@gmail.com</p>
            
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information. Some countries give you non-waivable rights. Nothing here limits those.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Reality check:</strong> No policy can guarantee disputes never occur, but this notice is designed to minimize risk by being precise, conservative, and transparent.</p>
            
            <h2>Quick Summary (plain language)</h2>
            <p>We collect: the info you provide (profile, messages, photos), device/usage data, optional location, and data from sign-in providers.</p>
            <p>We use data to run SportsPal (profiles, discovery, activities, messaging), keep users safe (moderation, anti-abuse), and improve performance/analytics.</p>
            <p>Profiles and activity participation are visible to others; your exact real-time location is not publicly posted without your action (we use approximate distances for discovery).</p>
            <p>We do not sell your data and do not share it for cross-context behavioral advertising under California law.</p>
            <p>You control permissions (location, camera, notifications), and you can access, export, correct, or delete your data.</p>
            <p>Messages are not end-to-end encrypted; we may review content for safety and to enforce rules.</p>
            <p>Data may be processed outside your country with lawful transfer safeguards.</p>
            
            <h2>1) Scope and Definitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Service:</strong> SportsPal mobile apps, sites, APIs, and related features.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal data / personal information:</strong> Information that identifies or can reasonably identify you.</p>
            <p><strong>Sensitive data:</strong> Categories defined by law (e.g., precise location, government IDs, financial data, health info, sexual life). We do not require you to provide sensitive data; do not include it in your profile or chats.</p>
            <p><strong>Controller:</strong> SportsPal acts as controller for your data when you use the Service.</p>
            
            <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>A. Information you provide</h3>
            <p><strong>Account & Profile:</strong> name/username, email, password (hashed), bio, interests, favorite sports, profile photo/video, pronouns (optional).</p>
            <p><strong>Content:</strong> messages, photos/videos, activity titles/descriptions, comments, reactions, reports, and any attachments you upload.</p>
            <p><strong>Preferences:</strong> discovery radius, visibility, notifications, language, theme.</p>
            <p><strong>Support & Verification:</strong> inquiries, appeals, safety reports; if we request, limited ID info to verify identity for safety workflows (optional, where lawful).</p>
            
            <h3>B. Information collected automatically</h3>
            <p><strong>Location (optional):</strong> approximate or precise location if you grant permission (to power discovery, distance, and safety/anti-abuse).</p>
            <p><strong>Device & diagnostics:</strong> device model, OS, app version, language, performance metrics, crash logs.</p>
            <p><strong>Identifiers:</strong> device/app identifiers, push token, IP address (security, geofencing, anti-abuse).</p>
            <p><strong>Usage data:</strong> feature use, screens viewed, timestamps, referrers/UTM.</p>
            
            <h3>C. Information from others</h3>
            <p><strong>Sign-in providers:</strong> Apple, Google, or others you choose (e.g., name, email, auth token).</p>
            <p><strong>Payments (if/when offered):</strong> limited billing metadata from processors (we do not store full card numbers).</p>
            <p><strong>Safety/anti-abuse services:</strong> results from spam/fraud detection, block lists.</p>
            <p>We do not intentionally collect special category/sensitive data. Do not post it.</p>
            
            <h2>3) How We Use Information (Purposes & Legal Bases)</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Service delivery & core features</strong> (accounts, profiles, discovery, activities, chat, notifications).<br>
            Legal bases: Contract; Legitimate interests (smooth, safe service).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Safety, integrity, and moderation</strong> (detecting fraud/spam/abuse; processing reports; enforcing rules; protecting users).<br>
            Legal bases: Legitimate interests; Legal obligation; Vital interests (in emergencies).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Location features</strong> (showing nearby activities/people; distance estimates; combating spam via geosignals).<br>
            Legal bases: Contract; Consent (where required); Legitimate interests.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Analytics & performance</strong> (improve reliability, speed, UX; troubleshoot).<br>
            Legal bases: Legitimate interests; Consent where required (e.g., in the EEA for certain analytics SDKs).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Communications</strong> (transactional and safety notifications; optional marketing with consent or as permitted by law).<br>
            Legal bases: Contract; Legitimate interests; Consent (marketing where required).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Compliance & defense</strong> (legal obligations, tax/accounting, responding to lawful requests, defending legal claims).<br>
            Legal bases: Legal obligation; Legitimate interests.</p>
            
            <p>We do not use automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects without human involvement. We use ranking/matching signals and safety heuristics to prioritize relevant results and detect abuse.</p>
            
            <h2>4) Location Data</h2>
            <p><strong>Choice:</strong> You can grant/deny location permission in system settings at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> discovery, distance, safety/anti-abuse, basic analytics.</p>
            <p><strong>Display:</strong> We generally show approximate distance, not your exact coordinates.</p>
            <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> GPS and network signals can be inaccurate; do not rely on the app for safety-critical navigation.</p>
            
            <h2>5) Messaging, Media, and Moderation</h2>
            <p>Messages are not end-to-end encrypted.</p>
            <p>We may scan, review, or analyze content (including messages and metadata) using automated tools and/or human review to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>enforce our Community Rules and Terms;</li>
                <li>detect spam/fraud/malware;</li>
                <li>respond to user reports and legal requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do not share information you consider highly confidential.</p>
            
            <h2>6) Sharing and Disclosures</h2>
            <p>We do not sell personal information and do not share it for cross-context behavioral advertising under California law.</p>
            <p>We share the minimum necessary with:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Other users:</strong> your public profile and content (e.g., activity participation, profile photo, username, sports). Messages are visible to chat participants.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Service providers (processors):</strong> hosting, databases, storage/CDN, push notifications, analytics/crash reporting, moderation/anti-abuse, email, build/OTA update services—each bound by contracts to process data only for us.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Change of control:</strong> in a merger, acquisition, or asset transfer, your data may transfer under this policy's protections.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Legal/safety:</strong> to comply with law or protect the rights, property, or safety of SportsPal, our users, or the public (e.g., valid court orders, emergency threats).</p>
            
            <h2>7) International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where we transfer personal data from the EEA/UK, we rely on lawful transfer mechanisms (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses and UK addendum) and apply appropriate safeguards.</p>
            
            <h2>8) Retention</h2>
            <p>We keep data only as long as necessary for the purposes above, including security/fraud prevention and legal compliance, then delete or anonymize it.</p>
            <p>Typical periods (subject to change for safety/legal holds):</p>
            <p><strong>Account & profile:</strong> while your account is active and up to 24 months after deletion (to allow recovery and defend against abuse/fraud).</p>
            <p><strong>Messages & activities:</strong> while your account is active; selected records may persist longer for safety/legal reasons.</p>
            <p><strong>Logs/diagnostics:</strong> 12–24 months.</p>
            <p><strong>Reports & enforcement:</strong> retained as long as necessary to protect users and comply with law.</p>
            
            <h2>9) Your Choices & Controls</h2>
            <p><strong>Permissions:</strong> manage location, camera, photos, microphone, and notifications in device settings.</p>
            <p><strong>Discovery & visibility:</strong> adjust profile visibility and discovery radius.</p>
            <p><strong>Marketing:</strong> opt out in-app or via "unsubscribe."</p>
            <p><strong>Blocking & reports:</strong> block users and report content anytime.</p>
            <p><strong>Data requests:</strong> access/export, correct, or delete your data by emailing sportspalapplication@gmail.com from your account email. We may verify identity before acting.</p>
            
            <h2>10) Your Rights by Region</h2>
            
            <h3>EEA & UK (GDPR/UK-GDPR)</h3>
            <p>You have the right to access, correct, delete, restrict, object, and data portability; to withdraw consent (doesn't affect prior processing); and to lodge a complaint with your data protection authority (e.g., Hellenic DPA in Greece, ICO in the UK).</p>
            
            <h3>U.S. States (e.g., CA/CPRA, CO, CT, VA, UT)</h3>
            <p>You may have rights to know/access, correct, delete, and port personal information, and to opt out of targeted advertising, sale, and certain profiling. We do not "sell" personal information and do not "share" it for cross-context behavioral advertising. You may authorize an agent to make requests. We will verify requests.</p>
            
            <h3>Brazil (LGPD)</h3>
            <p>You may request confirmation of processing, access, correction, anonymization, portability, deletion, and information about sharing; and to revoke consent.</p>

            <p><strong>How to exercise rights (all regions):</strong> Email sportspalapplication@gmail.com. We'll respond within the timelines required by law and may request verification.</p>
            
            <h2>11) Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>SportsPal is not intended for users under 16 in the EEA/UK (or the age required by your country) and under 13 elsewhere. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child is using SportsPal, contact us; we will take appropriate action.</p>
            
            <h2>12) Security</h2>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards (encryption in transit, access controls, least-privilege, monitoring). No system is 100% secure. Protect your account with a strong, unique password and secure your devices.</p>
            <p><strong>Incident response:</strong> We assess and respond to suspected breaches and will notify you and/or regulators as required by law.</p>
            
            <h2>13) Cookies, SDKs, and Similar Technologies</h2>
            <p>We do not use traditional browser cookies inside the mobile app, but we use SDKs and similar technologies for authentication, analytics/crash reporting, performance metrics, push notifications, moderation/anti-abuse, and build/OTA updates. Where required (e.g., EEA), we request consent or offer opt-outs.</p>
            
            <h2>14) Third-Party Services and Links</h2>
            <p>The Service may link to or integrate third-party services (e.g., sign-in providers, maps, app stores). Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies. Use them at your discretion.</p>
            
            <h2>15) Law Enforcement and Legal Requests</h2>
            <p>We review legal requests to ensure they are valid and appropriately scoped. We may preserve or disclose information if we believe it's necessary to comply with law, court orders, or to protect users, our rights, or the public. We may notify affected users where lawful and feasible.</p>
            
            <h2>16) Do Not Track; Global Privacy Controls</h2>
            <p>Some browsers send "Do Not Track" or GPC signals. We do not respond to DNT signals at this time. We honor legally recognized opt-out signals where required by law.</p>
            
            <h2>17) Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Policy as our practices evolve. We will post the updated version with a new "Last Updated" date and, where appropriate, provide additional notice. Continued use of the Service means you accept the updated Policy.</p>
